I'm a minimalist, adhering to the KISS principle and embracing the philosophy of "do one thing and do it better". I only install and use plugins that are absolutely essential. I dislike those all-in-one plugins. I prefer plugins that enhance the native functionality of Vim and strongly avoid those that modify Vim's original features. For functionalities that can be implemented with just a few lines of code, I prefer to implement them myself, such as [LSP progress](./lua/rockyz/lsp/progress.lua), [lightbulb](./lua/rockyz/lsp/lightbulb.lua) and [indent guide](./lua/rockyz/autocmds.lua).

To see all the plugins I am using üëâ [plugins](./viml/plugins.vim)

# üöÄ Key mappings

I assign the key mappings rationally aiming to make them efficient and easy to remember.

* Multiple leader keys

  In addition to `<Space>` that is the general leader key, `,` serves as the leader key for git, while `<BS>` functions as the leader key for toggling.

* Mnemonic

  Key bindings are organized using mnemonic prefixes like `<Leader>b` for buffer, `<Leader>f` for fuzzy finder, `<Leader>w` for window, and so forth.

* Consistent

  Similar functionalities have the same key binding throughout my dotfiles. For example, `,` and `.` for moving tabs in both kitty and Neovim.

# üé™ Showcases

### Blazing fast fuzzy finder via [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) and [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

Use `fzf` for the performance-critical operations such as files finder and grep, and `telescope` for interacting with other plugins such as [nvim-navbuddy](https://github.com/SmiteshP/nvim-navbuddy) due to its great ecosystem.

### Ultimate fold with [nvim-ufo](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-ufo)

Now the fold is asynchronous and powered by LSP with a customizable appearance for the folded line and peek window.

### Enhanced quickfix window with [nvim-bqf](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-bqf)

Equip the quickfix with a preview window and an interactive filter (backed by `fzf`), and introduce many convenient actions for quickfix.
