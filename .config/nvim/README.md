To see all the plugins I am using üëâ [plugins](./.config/nvim/viml/plugins.vim)

# üöÄ Key mappings

I assign the key mappings rationally aiming to make them efficient and easy to remember.

* Multiple leader keys

  In addition to `<Space>` that is the general leader key, `<BS>` and `,` are set as the leader keys for toggling and LSP respectively.

* Mnemonic

  Key bindings are organized using mnemonic prefixes like `<Leader>b` for buffer, `<Leader>f` for fuzzy finder, `<Leader>w` for window, etc.
  
* Consistent

  Similar functionalities have the same key binding throughout my dotfiles. For example, `,` and `.` for moving tabs in both kitty and Neovim.
